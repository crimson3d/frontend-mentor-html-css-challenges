## Acknowledgments

Thanks to all the people 

Many thanks to all the people who support me in this new adventure, to Paul Guillamon (https://github.com/Qu4k3), my master Yoda and mentor to become a developer, to May, the best companion and love I could ever have, and to Lara, probably the reason why now I'm doing this. Love.
